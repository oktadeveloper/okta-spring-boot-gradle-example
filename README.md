## Getting Started

To install this example application, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-boot-gradle-example.git
```

This will get a copy of the project locally. 

### Create an OIDC App in Okta

Log in to your Okta Developer account (or [sign up](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) if you donâ€™t have an account) and navigate to **Security** > **API**. Grab the issuer value from your `default` authorization server.

Copy it into `gradle.properties`:

```properties
oauthIssuer=https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default  
```

**NOTE:** The value of `{yourOktaDomain}` should be something like `dev-123456.okta.com`. Make sure you don't include `-admin` in the value!

### Start the application

To start the application you can just run:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```
